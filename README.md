## Introduction

Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB you'll learn how to build a Full Stack MERN Application - from start to finish. The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

By the end of this video, you will have a strong understanding of how the MERN Stack works.

Setup:

- run `npm i && npm start` for both client and server side to start the app

TODO: rename post message, refactor reducers, add some cool memories, maybe clickable tags, fix update functionality
